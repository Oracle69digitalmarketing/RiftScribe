# RiftScribe - 3-Minute Demo Video Script

**Objective:** To create a compelling, concise, and professional video that showcases RiftScribe's features and technical excellence, directly addressing all hackathon judging criteria.

**Total Runtime:** ~2 minutes, 45 seconds

---

### **Scene 1: The Problem & The Promise (0:00 - 0:30)**

**(Visuals):**
*   (0:00 - 0:10) Quick, flashy cuts of high-energy League of Legends gameplay. Then, transition to a screen showing a dense, boring spreadsheet of match data (like from op.gg).
*   (0:10 - 0:30) Smoothly fade to the beautiful, atmospheric landing page of the RiftScribe application. The cursor elegantly types in the summoner name "PlayerOne".

**(Voiceover - Confident, Epic Tone):**
"Every League of Legends player has a story. A season of triumphs, struggles, and unforgettable moments. But that story is often lost, buried in endless rows of raw data."

*(Pause as the RiftScribe landing page appears)*

"What if we could do more than just show stats? What if we could forge that data into a legend? This is RiftScribe: a personalized AI agent that transforms your season into an epic, shareable saga."

### **Scene 2: Choosing Your Storyteller (0:30 - 1:00)**

**(Visuals):**
*   (0:30 - 0:45) The cursor hovers over each of the three Persona cards (Bard, Zilean, Olaf), showing the hover effects. It clicks on "Olaf, the Berserker," and the card glows with a golden border.
*   (0:45 - 1:00) The cursor clicks the "Forge My Saga" button. The screen transitions to the immersive loading screen, cycling through the thematic messages like "Sharpening the axes of narrative..." and "Recalling glorious slaughters...".

**(Voiceover):**
"The journey begins by choosing your storyteller. Will your saga be a mystical poem told by Bard? A historical record recounted by Zilean? Or a savage war-chant from Olaf the Berserker?"

"We'll choose Olaf for a tale of pure glory. With a single click, RiftScribe's backend, running on AWS, begins its work."

### **Scene 3: The AWS Backend in Action (1:00 - 1:30)**

**(Visuals):**
*   (1:00 - 1:15) Show a clean, simple architectural diagram (like the one we designed). An icon representing the user's request flows from the browser, to API Gateway, to an AWS Lambda function.
*   (1:15 - 1:30) Inside the Lambda icon, show text snippets representing our logic: "Analyze Player Insights," "Construct AI Prompt," then show icons for Amazon Bedrock (one for text, one for images). Arrows show the request going to Bedrock and the response coming back.

**(Voiceover - More Technical Tone):**
"Our frontend, hosted on AWS Amplify, sends a request to a secure API Gateway endpoint. This triggers our core AWS Lambda function, which analyzes the player's performance data to extract deep, meaningful insights—like their most played champions, their win rates, and even their arch-nemesis."

"These insights are then woven into a dynamic prompt and sent to Amazon Bedrock. First, to a large language model like Claude to generate the narrative, and then in parallel to an image model like Stability AI to create custom, epic artwork for each chapter."

### **Scene 4: The Unveiling of the Saga (1:30 - 2:15)**

**(Visuals):**
*   (1:30 - 1:45) The loading screen fades away, and the stunning Saga View appears. The video slowly scrolls down, showing the epic title and the first chapter with its unique, AI-generated artwork.
*   (1:45 - 2:00) Continue scrolling, showing the second chapter with different art. Use a callout or a subtle zoom to highlight a specific data point mentioned in the text (e.g., "crushing his nemesis, Darius...").
*   (2:00 - 2:15) Show the final chapter and the footer buttons.

**(Voiceover - Return to Epic Tone):**
"The result is not a dashboard—it's a legend. A multi-chapter story that's unique to every player. RiftScribe highlights the player's most dominant performance and their struggles, transforming raw statistics into a compelling narrative."

"The AI-generated artwork brings each chapter to life, creating a truly personal and memorable experience that goes far beyond what any typical stat site can offer."

### **Scene 5: Share Your Legend (2:15 - 2:45)**

**(Visuals):**
*   (2:15 - 2:30) The cursor clicks the "Share Your Legend" button. The beautiful Share Card modal appears.
*   (2:30 - 2:45) The cursor clicks the "Download Card" button, and the browser's download prompt appears for the PNG file. Finally, the cursor clicks "Share on X," opening a new tab with a pre-filled tweet.

**(Voiceover):**
"And when the saga is told, it's meant to be shared. The Share Card feature creates a beautiful, high-quality summary of the player's season, perfect for social media."

"With a single click, players can download their Legend Card or share their story with the world. This is RiftScribe: Your Season, Your Story—Forged into Legend. Thank you."

**(Final Visual):** End on a clean screen with the RiftScribe logo and "Built with AWS Generative AI".
